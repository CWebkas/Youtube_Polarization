# Youtube_Polarization
This is originally born out of a class assignment, but I decided to take it further, since polarization through social media is a publicly relevant issue. 

In the project I request Video Info via API on a politically relevant search term, do basic analytics and then do network analysis of the recommended videos.

Further goals are: Training a model to categorize videos in political dimensions: Left, Right; Populist, Informative and so on.
Final goal is to investigate the Hypothesis, that polarizing content tends to be more often recommended, independent of popularity.
Suggestions are welcome.
